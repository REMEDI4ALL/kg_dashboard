R4A_SOC:1	Hit Identification and validation							Hit identification experimental guidelines demonstrate assay or processes that can allow for the identification and nomination of hits, such as proteomics experiments, CRISPR genomics, cell painting assay, or drug combination screening. For the validation of hits the respective guidelines allow for target or mechanism of action (MoA) elucidation such as phospholipidosis assays, redox assays, target engagement requirements etc.  
R4A_SOC:2	Computational analysis							Computational analysis covers in-silico guidelines that can complement and assist experimental activities to allow for smart selection such as toxicity evaluation, compound screening prioritization, safety assessment, etc
R4A_SOC:3	Data management and quality							Data management and quality covers generic guidelines allowing to check for quality of the data generated through the SOGs and future prospective of data dissemination such as FAIR data assessment of data, cell-based screening data validation, hit quality control etc.
R4A_SOC:4	Others							Others covers topic relevant to drug discovery but might not necessarily be part of the remaining catgeories.
