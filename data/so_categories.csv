R4A_SOC:1,Pre-clinical experimental workflows,"Hit identification experimental guidelines demonstrate assay or processes that can allow for the identification and nomination of hits, such as proteomics experiments, CRISPR genomics, cell painting assay, or drug combination screening. For the validation of hits the respective guidelines allow for target or mechanism of action (MoA) elucidation such as phospholipidosis assays, redox assays, target engagement requirements etc."
R4A_SOC:2,Computational analysis,"Computational analysis covers in-silico guidelines that can complement and assist experimental activities to allow for smart selection such as toxicity evaluation, compound screening prioritization safety assessment etc."
R4A_SOC:3,Data management and quality,Data management and quality covers generic guidelines allowing to check for quality of the data generated through the SOGs and future prospective of data dissemination such as FAIR data assessment of data cell-based screening data validation hit quality control etc.
R4A_SOC:4,Pre-clinical research reporting,"Provides guidelines for systematically documenting and communicating experimental procedures, results, and analyses generated during preclinical studies. This includes standardized reporting formats, metadata annotation, quality control documentation, and mechanisms to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and compliance with FAIR principles, facilitating data sharing, regulatory review, and integration into downstream computational analyses."
