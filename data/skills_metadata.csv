For antibiotics, the most common mechanisms of action are: Inhibition of cell wall synthesis Inhibition of protein synthesis Disruption of cell membranes Inhibition of DNA replication or transcription Inhibition of bacterial metabolism For compounds identified in phenotypic screens, mechanisms of action may not be immediately obvious. Further studies are required to understand how they achieve their antibacterial effects. Determining mechanism of action is important because it suggests what modifications could be made to a compound to improve its activity and specificity. In addition, antibiotics used as combinations should ideally have different mechanisms of actions, to make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance to treatment.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/mechanism-of-action-moa/
Drug Discovery Group,Pharmacodynamics (PD),SKILLS:030,"Study of the uptake, movement, binding and interactions of drugs in the body and how they affect drug activity. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. Any factor affecting drug concentration at its target site, strength of binding or duration of binding will affect that drug's pharmacological activity and clinical responses. Broadly speaking, pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body, while pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacodynamics-pd/
Drug Discovery Group,Pharmacokinetics (PK),SKILLS:029,"Study of the body's handling and metabolism of drugs in the body, including their absorption, distribution between different tissues, localization within tissues, modification and excretion (ADME). Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. If the body does not absorb a drug, modifies it chemically, or rapidly excretes it, the drug will be less able to bind to its target site and have a biological effect. Broadly speaking, pharmacokinetics considers the effect of the body on a drug, while pharmacodynamics considers the properties of a drug that affect target engagement in the body. Population PK modelling takes account of variation in how drugs are metabolized by different people within a population. This requires more sophisticated statistical methodologies but provides results more relevant to individuals. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models are more closely based on human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. They are complex multi-component models that more accurately reflect human biology but are also more challenging to develop.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/pharmacokinetics-pk/
Drug Discovery Group,Natural products,SKILLS:025,"Natural products are small molecules produced by living organisms including plants, invertebrates and microorganisms. They are also known as secondary metabolites being non-essential for life, but they play key roles in defence and cell to cell communication. They represent a unique chemical space with compounds distributed in a broad diversity of chemical classes. They have been evolving with nature together with the activities that have been optimized together with the targets. Pharmaceutical companies have been using natural products for decades as one of the major sources for discovery of novel bio-active compounds and today more than 50% of the molecules in development are still natural products, semi-synthetic derivatives or have been inspired in these scaffolds. Today, natural products are still an untapped reservoir with more than 90% of the microbial sources still underexplored and with biosynthetic potential that by far exceeds the initial estimations. This is why natural products still represent one of the major sources of chemical diversity and one of the starting points for the discovery of novel antibiotics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/natural-products/
Drug Discovery Group,Absorption distribution metabolism elimination (ADME),SKILLS:027,"The key factors affecting the concentration and distribution of a drug within the body and the time it spends in the body. Drug activity depends on engagement between a drug and its molecular target. How a drug is absorbed, distributed across different tissues (or compartments), metabolized and eliminated (e.g. excreted) will all affect its ability to access its target site and have a biological effect. ADME are the core elements of pharmacokinetics.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/absorption-distribution-metabolism-elimination-adme/

Drug Discovery Group,In-vitro toxicity testing - Ames,SKILLS:028,"A method for evaluating the mutagenic effects of a compound or drug, used as part of toxicity testing. The test chemical is applied to a bacterial strain that has a mutation which renders it dependent on histidine for growth, along with a rat liver extract (to explore the potential for enzymatic processing of the chemical into a mutagenic form). After culture, the number of colonies that can grow in the absence of histidine, due to reversion of the mutation, provides a measure of the mutagenic potential of the chemical. There is a reasonable degree of correlation between mutagenicity as judged by the Ames essay and carcinogenicity in animal models. However, it is a screening tool with limited predictability when used without other assays.",https://revive.gardp.org/resource/ames-test/

Typically, multiple chemical variants of a hit compound are synthesized (hit expansion). Studies of these compounds help to identify key structural features of the compound associated with binding to molecular targets and efficacy (structure-activity relationships).
