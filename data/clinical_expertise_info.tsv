ICF Development	"A Informed Consent Development (ICF) is a process in which patients are given important information, including possible risks and benefits, about a medical procedure or treatment, genetic testing, or a clinical trial. This is to help them decide if they want to be treated, tested, or take part in the trial. Patients are also given any new information that might affect their decision to continue.

Networking with Investigators	"The investigator is responsible for the conduct of a clinical trial at a trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a trial site, the investigator is the leader responsible for the team and may be called the principal investigator. This expertise invovles networking with stakeholder investigators throughtout the study."	REMEDi4ALL	
Networking with Patient Engagement Initiatives	"Patient engagement describes the process of actively involving patients in their own healthcare. This includes sharing decision-making, self-management, and partnering with healthcare providers."	HRS	https://www.healthrecoverysolutions.com/resources/eguide/patient-engagement-guide
Orphan Drug Designation	A status assigned to a medicine intended for use against a rare condition.

Peer Review Protocol evaluation	"Protocol is a document that describes the objective(s), design, methodology, statistical considerations and organisation of a trial. The term protocol refers to the protocol, successive versions of the protocol and protocol amendments. The clinical trial protocol peer-review process is where many experts examine the proposed trial to consider aspects such as study design, trial procedures, subject eligibility, feasibility, acceptability, and study endpoints."	Publication	https://doi.org/10.56012/fbfu9448
Placebo development	"A placebo is a control substance (a dummy treatment) that is given to people taking part in a clinical trial. It allows researchers to test for the ""placebo effect"". This is a psychological response where people feel better even though the substance they are taking has no effect. By comparing people's responses to the placebo and to the drug being tested, researchers can tell whether the drug is having any real benefit."	WikiData	https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q7200267

Support in Investigator Selection	"The investigator is responsible for the conduct of a clinical trial at a trial site. If a trial is conducted by a team of individuals at a trial site, the investigator is the leader responsible for the team and may be called the principal investigator. Site and investigator selection has traditionally been the result of a comprehensive process by which a study sponsor and/or designated representative, often a contract research organization (CRO), evaluates prospective investigative teams and associated clinical sites for clinical trial participation."
